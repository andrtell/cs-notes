LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdlib.h>

       void *malloc(size_t size);
       void free(void *_Nullable ptr);

DESCRIPTION
   malloc()
       The  malloc()  function  allocates size bytes and returns a pointer to the allocated memory.
       The memory is not initialized.  If size is 0, then malloc() returns a unique pointer value
       that can later be successfully passed to free().

   free()
       The free() function frees the memory space pointed to by ptr, which must have been returned
       by a previous call to malloc() or related functions.
       Otherwise, or if ptr has already been freed, undefined behavior occurs.
       If ptr is NULL, no operation is performed.
```
